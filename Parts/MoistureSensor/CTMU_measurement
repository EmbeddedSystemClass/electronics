Measurement of a capacitive (relative) value with CTMU
How it work

the current source charge an external capacitor (PCB electrodes in our case) to a Voltage in time.
When the current and time are contant, the voltage increase or decrease inversely with the capacitor value.
When water is in contact of the electrodes, the capacitance increase and the voltage decrease.
The exacte amont of capacitance depends on how much water there is in the soil (and minerals too)
The Voltage is mesured at frequent intervals by the microcontroller's **A/D converter**.
